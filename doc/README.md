ResPubliqa Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
[ResPubliqa Core](http://respubliqa.org/wallet) is the original ResPubliqa client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of ResPubliqa transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run ResPubliqa Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/respubliqa-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/respubliqad` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run respubliqa-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag ResPubliqa-Qt to your applications folder, and then run ResPubliqa-Qt.
